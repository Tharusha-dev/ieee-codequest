## Third-Party Resources Used

- Google Fonts (VT323 for typography)

  

## SEO and Performance Optimizations 

-  **SEO:** Descriptive title, meta description, and relevant keywords to the main page to improve its search engine ranking.

-  **Image Performance:** Replaced the main header's CSS background image with a Next.js `<Image>` component. This enables automatic optimization, including serving modern formats like WebP and lazy loading.

-  **Load Performance:** Implemented dynamic loading for several components. Now, sections like "Introduction," "Timeline," and "Prizes" will only load when they are about to enter the viewport, speeding up the initial page load time.
